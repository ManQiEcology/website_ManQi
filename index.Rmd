Hi, Welcome to my website! I am a coastal community ecologist, theoretical ecologist, and ecological modeler. 

I am interested in deciphering the dynamics of intraspecific/interspecific interactions and the mechanisms driving species stability/coexistence amidst varying physical stressors. My focus is on gaining insights into how these ecological processes influence ecosystem stabilities, particularly in the face of a changing climate. 

My research are mostly problem or hypothesis driven. I use field in situ experiment, greenhouse experiment, ecological models and remote sensing techniques (drones, airborne data,and satelite data) to understand the mechanisms maintain population/community stability at various spatial scale. I am keen on applying these mechanistic understandings to contribute to nature-based conservation and restoration initiatives.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
