## **Education**
### Ph.D., Beijing Normal University | 2012 – 2018  
Environmental Science, Dr. Tao Sun)                                               . Visiting scholar (funded by scholarship) at Faculty of ITC, University of Twente. The Netherlands
  · Academic scholarship of Beijing Normal University (first prize, 2 out of 40)
  · Invited talk on watershed system resilience by Workshop of Social-ecological Resilience of Freshwater Systems in the Anthropocene
### Bachelor, Northwest A&F University | 2008 – 2012
Environmental Science                                                         
  · Outstanding graduate (3 out of 300)
  · Chinese National Scholarship (10, 5 out of 300)                             
## **Professional working experience**
### Marie Curie fellow/postdoc, University of Oxford | 2023 – Current
I am pioneering a novel framework to predict population collapse basing on the systematic understanding of relationship between individual fitness-related traits and population density. The novel early warning metrics of population collapse that I will propose will significantly lower the cost and time required of current methods such as PVAs or EWSs. 
  · Marie Curie postdoc fellowship on predicting population collapse with relationships between individual fitness-related traits and population density
  · Invited webinar on coastal marshes survival under climate change, Estuarine & Coastal Sciences Association

### Senior Lecturer, Central China Normal University | 2020 – 2023
I lead independent research on how varying interspecific interaction within and across trophic levels inform ecosystem resilience under climate change and anthropogenic disturbances.
I also taught undergrad courses on Environmental Ecology, Academic writing, Natural Geography, and several graduate classes centered on Protected Area and Global Conservation.
  · NSF of China young scientist fund on coastal marsh stability under drought
  · NSF of Hubei Province young scientist fund on aquatic plant community succession
  · Research grant from Chinese Forestry Society on marsh plant community stability
  · Most Popular Class (Environmental Ecology) for Undergrads
  · Outstanding Research Award, Social Science Federation of Shandong Province
  · Consultant of Social Science Federation of Shandong Province
### Postdoc, George Washington University | 2018 – 2020
I studied the lateral and vertical stability maintaining mechanisms of coastal marshes threated by sea level rise, and proposed reservation/restoration faced managing strategies to extend the longevity and maximize the function of coastal marshes.
  · Research grant from Washington Field Biologist Club on early transition of marsh into ponds, 
  · Research grant from MAPAIS on invasive understory common reed detection, 
  · Application in marsh restoration: research output guided U. S. Army Corps of Engineers in site selection of a marsh restoration project ($5 million budget)  
  · Invited talk on marsh deterioration and resilience by USGS Marsh Seminar

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
